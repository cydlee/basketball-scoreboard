# Basketball Scoreboard
Basketball scoreboard for high school basketball made with <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib">raylib</a>. <br>
Not ready for use in games.

Please report any issues if you find any!

## Build (GNU/Linux)
First, set up raylib. GNU/Linux guide is <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux">here</a>. <br>
Then, run `./build.sh`. <br>
I have no idea how to compile for other platforms.
