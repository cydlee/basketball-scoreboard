# Basketball Scoreboard
Basketball scoreboard for high school basketball

## Build (GNU/Linux)
First, set up Raylib. GNU/Linux guide is <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux">here</a>. <br>
Then, run `./build.sh`. <br>
I have no idea how to compile for other platforms.
