===== Build =====

GNU/Linux
  1. Install raylib.
     <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux>
  2. Run the build script 'build.sh'.
  3. The default output name is 'scoreboard' (run './scoreboard'). It can be
     renamed by editing the build script.
[ no Windows or macOS guide yet - sorry :( ]


===== How to Use =====

The scoreboard has four different modes: 
    CLOCK_STOPPED ------- no clocks are running
    CLOCK_RUNNING ------- main clock and shot clock counting down
    SHOT_CLOCK_RUNNING -- only shot clock counting down
    EDIT_MODE ----------- no clocks running, allows editing time on clocks

    The clock modes have very similar controls, while edit mode has a different
set of controls.
    During the clock modes, the scoreboard data is unlocked and can be changed.
In addition, the main clock and shot clock can count down or be stopped, and
the shot clock has the additional functionality of being reset. The shot clock
can be reset to 35 seconds while running or stopped, and set to 30 or 60
seconds while stopped. Pressing [SPACE] starts and stops the clock, and pressing
[LEFT CONTROL] starts and stops the shot clock only (for timeouts). To change
scoreboard data, you must select the team's data you wish to change, as well as
the type of data to change. [H] and [V] select home and visitor, respectively.
[S] selects score, [F] selects fouls, [T] selects timeouts left, and [P] selects
the period (which is not affected by [H] or [V]). To actually change the data,
press [-] and [+]. For score specifically, you can also use [1], [2], and [3].
Also, pressing [G] will sound the game buzzer.
    Edit mode is designed to allow you to correct the time on the main clock or
shot clock, or to set the time of the main clock at the beginning of a quarter
or halftime (or anything else). During edit mode, one of the digits on the main
clock or shot clock will be selected, which can be overwritten using one of the
number keys. Pressing [ENTER] will save changes and return to CLOCK_STOPPED
mode, while pressing [BACKSPACE] will discard changes and return. While in edit
mode, the controls for editing the scoreboard data will not work.
