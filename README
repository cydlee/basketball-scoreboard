===== Contribute =====

At this point in time I don't have much experience with code collaboration, and
I don't really expect any contributions. But, if you do want to contribute,
it's probably best to leave an issue with example code instead of making a pull
request.

The 'main' branch contains a stable version of the program that is suitable for
use in games.

New features will be developed in a separate branch named 'dev'. (version 4+)


===== Build =====

GNU/Linux
  1. Install raylib.
     <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux>
  2. Run the build script 'build.sh'.
  3. The default output name is 'scoreboard' (run './scoreboard'). It can be
     renamed by editing the build script.
[ no Windows or macOS guide yet - sorry :( ]


===== How to Use =====

The scoreboard has two modes:
  CLOCK_MODE - normal use
  EDIT_MODE -- special mode for correcting time or resetting the main clock

Each mode has separate controls described in the Controls Reference.

Changing Data:
  The scoreboard always has a selected team and data type. When you press plus
or minus, the selected data type will be incremented or decremented depending
on the selected field. For score specifically, you can press 1-2-3 to add to
the score. Pressing [H]ome and [V]isitor change the selected team, and pressing
[S]core, [F]ouls, [T]imeouts left, and [P]eriod change the selected type. The
combination of these two are the selected field. For example, [H]-[S] selects
the home team's score box. Then, pressing [2] will add two points to it. Period
can be changed regardless of what team is selected, so [V]-[P] and [H]-[P] are
equivalent. However, the selected team will still be changed by [H] and [V].

Clocks:
  If one of the clocks has no time left, neither clock will actually run, even
if the clock is set to running. While a clock is running and its time is equal
to zero, the game buzzer will sound. [SPACE] starts both clocks when they are
both stopped, and stops all clocks in any other case. [L-CTRL] starts and stops
the shot clock independently, and [R-CTRL] starts and stops the main clock.
[L-SHIFT] resets the shot clock to 35 seconds and resets the timeout clock to
30 or 60 seconds (60 when it is already equal to 30). To switch between shot
and timeout clocks, press [L-ALT] while all clocks are stopped. Note that the
main clock will not run when the timeout clock is being displayed.

Edit Mode:
  When there is a timing error or the main clock needs to be set, you can use
edit mode. To enter edit mode, press [/] or [\]. Edit mode can only be entered
while both clocks are stopped. During edit mode, some controls do different
things. For example, [L-SHIFT] changes whether tenth-seconds are shown on the
clock. Use the arrow keys to change which digit is selected, the number keys to
change the selected digit, and [ENTER] to save changes and quit edit mode. If
you made a mistake and want to discard your changes, press [BACKSPACE].

Refer to the Controls Reference for any controls not explained in this section.
